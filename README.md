# Star-Os
Star os aims to be a complete yet lightweight linux distribution based on the latest linux kernel release(6.8.3) wich is combined with Glibc and busybox to provide many useful commands and also add the possibility to use networking features (wg. wget curl)
It also includes a simple package manager!
